# Code Refactoring

## Description

Refactor the codebase of the webpage of a marketing agency, called Horiseon, to meet the accessibility standards. It makes the website and its contents more user-friendly and easy to understand for all users especially people with disabilities. 

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Changes

* Added a concise, descriptive title
* Converted all non-semantic elements to semantic elements
* Added "alt" attribute for images with description
* Consolidated the repetitive css properties
* Added the missing id for the navigation element
* Commented on HTML and CSS files for readability
